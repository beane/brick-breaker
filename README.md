# Brick Breaker

Welcome to my brick-breaker game!

Much thanks to [keymaster](https://github.com/madrobby/keymaster) for key bindings.

This is one of my first projects written in JavaScript. It emphasizes well-organized, object-oriented, and clean, namespaced code.

## Technologies

 - [keymaster](https://github.com/madrobby/keymaster)
 - Canvas
 - JavaScript
 - Object-oriented design

## What to do
Download the whole file. (There is a button to download a zipped version on the right.) Open the index.html file in your favorite browser. Enjoy.

## Gameplay
Left and right arrow keys (or 'a' and 'd') to move.
Spacebar currently stops the game, but does not pause it.

## Note
The paddle bug is fixed! Thanks to Daniel, my new hero.
